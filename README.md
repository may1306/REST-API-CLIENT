## DESCRIPTION OF TASK

1. Tools Used

In this project, the following tools and libraries are used to design, build, and run the WeatherApp application:

Java Development Kit (JDK):
The Java Development Kit is the core tool required to write and execute Java programs. It includes the Java compiler (javac) to compile .java files into .class files and the Java Runtime Environment (java) to execute the compiled program. In our case, the WeatherApp.java file was compiled using javac and then executed with the java command.

Gson Library:
The project uses the Google Gson library (com.google.gson). Gson is an open-source Java library developed by Google to handle JSON parsing and serialization. It allows us to read a JSON file or string, convert it into Java objects, and easily extract required values. In this task, Gson is used to parse the weather data from a weather_sample.json file, extracting fields like city name, temperature, humidity, and description.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):
JSON is not a tool but a data format widely used to store and exchange data. In real-world applications, weather APIs such as OpenWeatherMap API provide data in JSON format. For this project, a local JSON file (weather_sample.json) was created to simulate API data.

Command Line (CMD / Terminal):
The Windows Command Prompt was used to compile and run the program. By specifying the classpath (-cp), we linked the Gson JAR file with our program to ensure successful compilation and execution. The command line is lightweight and directly communicates with the JDK.

2. Editor / Platform Used

Text Editor / IDE:
Java programs can be written in any text editor (Notepad, Notepad++, VS Code) or IDEs like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans. In this task, a simple text editor (such as Notepad) or a basic editor was enough to write the WeatherApp.java code. Many developers prefer IDEs because they provide syntax highlighting, debugging, and code suggestions, but for learning purposes, a basic editor works perfectly.

Execution Platform (Windows Environment):
The task was completed on a Windows system using the Command Prompt. The platform allowed us to navigate to the project directory (TASK2 folder), compile the Java code with javac, and run it with java. This method is platform-independent since Java can also be run on Linux and macOS with similar steps.

3. Applications of This Task

Building a small project like WeatherApp may seem simple, but it has many practical applications in real-world scenarios. Some of the key areas where this task is applicable are:

Weather Forecasting Applications:
Mobile and web apps like Google Weather, AccuWeather, or Yahoo Weather rely on fetching JSON data from APIs and displaying user-friendly weather information. Our task is a simplified version of such apps.

API Data Handling:
This project demonstrates how to handle structured JSON data in Java. Many real-world systems — like finance apps, IoT devices, social media apps, and e-commerce platforms — consume data in JSON format. The skills learned here are directly transferable to those fields.

Educational Use:
This task is very effective for teaching students how to parse JSON, integrate libraries, and work with external data. It bridges the gap between theoretical programming and practical implementation.

System Integration:
Weather information is often integrated into other systems like smart homes, agriculture monitoring, or transport systems. A Java program like this can serve as a backend utility to fetch and process weather data before sending it to other systems.

Resume & Skill Development:
For beginners in Java, demonstrating the ability to integrate external libraries (like Gson), parse JSON, and run projects from the command line shows practical knowledge beyond simple "Hello World" programs. Such projects can strengthen a resume or academic portfolio.
